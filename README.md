# Consulting_Project_Dashboard

## Objective
The purpose of this project was to develop a Consulting Project Dashboard to effectively track project milestones, measure performance, and ensure the timely completion of deliverables. The dashboard provides a real-time overview of project progress, highlighting key phases such as client onboarding, execution, and completion.

## Data
Consulting project performance & timeline(https://www.careerprinciples.com/)

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. Project Timeline Tracking – Start and end dates for each phase.
2. Task Duration Analysis – Measuring actual vs. planned duration.
3. Milestone Completion Rate – Percentage of completed tasks.
4. Client Onboarding Progress – Ensuring a smooth engagement initiation.
5. Overall Project Completion % – Summarising project progress.

## Process
Data Collection & Integration
The raw data was sourced from project management tools and tracking sheets.
Data cleaning was performed to remove inconsistencies and standardise date formats.

Dashboard Development
A Gantt Chart was used to visualise project phases and timelines.
Conditional formatting was applied to highlight delayed vs. on-time tasks.
Key metrics were summarised in a high-level executive dashboard.

Client onboarding progress can indicate whether the project is starting smoothly.
The Gantt Chart will help understand dependencies between tasks.
